    <h1>Welcome to The Bird Page</h1>
    <p>My name is Jordan Nnamani, and I love birds. I am fascinated by their ability to maintain flight, effortlessly gliding through the sky. Their wings, perfectly adapted for movement, allow them to soar, dive, and navigate vast distances with grace. Watching birds in flight has always inspired me, and that is why I decided to name my first website 'The Bird Page.'</p>
